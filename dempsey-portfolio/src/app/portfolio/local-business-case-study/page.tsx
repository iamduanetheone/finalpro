      <p>
        A well-established local service provider with over 15 years of operation was struggling to generate leads from their outdated website. Despite having an excellent reputation and a loyal customer base, their online presence didn't reflect their expertise or effectively communicate their value proposition.
      </p>
      <p>
        The business owner approached me after noticing declining website engagement and hearing from customers that they had difficulty finding information on their website. Additionally, they weren't ranking well for important local search terms, leading to missed opportunities with potential customers searching online.
      </p>
      <p>
        I was tasked with completely revamping their website copy to better communicate their services, highlight their unique value proposition, and improve their local SEO presenceâ€”all while maintaining the approachable, community-focused brand voice they had cultivated over the years.

          <strong>Local relevance matters more than keyword density.</strong> Strategic location references that sound natural performed better than forced keyword usage.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Clarity beats cleverness.</strong> Simple, clear explanations of services outperformed creative but vague messaging.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Service details reduce friction.</strong> Comprehensive service information built trust and reduced the number of clarification questions.
        </li>
        <li>
